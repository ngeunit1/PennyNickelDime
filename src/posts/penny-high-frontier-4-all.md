*Note: I have mixed feeling writing about Phil Eklund's games due content of his essays (Pax Pamir) as well as the content of some of his footnotes (ex. Pax Renaissance). For now, I will be writing about them since I am interested in working through how those feeling affect my experience of his games.*

A little bit of a cheat here, I have played High Frontier (Third Edition) once, so this is not my first High Frontier play, but it was my first High Frontier 4 All play. And what a way to play! We had help from a very experienced player which keeps things moving smoothly. We played the Core game + Politics mostly due to the timeframe we had to play, which for a *"Core"* game is still quite a lot of game.

I do tend to struggle a bit with sandbox games. My desire to explore the decision-making space and experiment often outweighs my desire to win, so I often lose sight of victory conditions. For example, I enjoyed messing around with the solar sail in my first High Frontier play, so when it popped up here, I felt like I had to jump on it. I went for some early glory points using the above-mentioned solar sail which was a fun start to the game. I had a bit of difficulty making industrialization-capable stack work. I had a few too many requirements and as a result the weight of my rocket kept going up and, well that can become a cycle. But eventually, my dirt powered monstrosity did some exploring, and progress was made.

We called it a bit early after talking about how we would have finished off the game, and again, I had more fun exploring towards the sun than away from it. I look forward to getting in a few more plays soon and getting to a point where I grok the rules and can start really "playing the game". If only it were a bit easier to find some High Frontier sized time frames to play it more often.
